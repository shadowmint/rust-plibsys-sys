# Config file support for find_package(plibsys). This needs to
# deal with two environments: (1) finding the build tree and (2)
# finding the install tree. plibsys-config.cmake detects which
# situation it is handing by looking at @PLIBSYS_ROOT_DIR@. If
# this is an absolute path, it's in the build tree; otherwise,
# it's in the install tree (note that the whole install tree
# can be relocated).
