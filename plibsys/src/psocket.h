 * @brief Socket implementation
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A socket is a communication primitive usually working over a network. You can
 * send data to someone's socket by its address and receive data as well through
 * the same socket. This is one of the most popular and standardizated way for
 * network communication supported by vast majority of all the modern operating
 * systems. It also hides all the details of underlying networking protocols and
 * other layers, providing a unified and transparent approach for communication.
 *
 * There are two kinds of socket:
 * - connection oriented (or stream sockets, i.e. TCP);
 * - connection-less (or datagram sockets, i.e. UDP).
 *
 * Connection oriented sockets work with data in a stream, connection-less
 * sockets work with data using independent packets (datagrams). The former
 * guarantees delivery, while the latter doesn't (actually some connection-less
 * protocols provide delivery quarantee, i.e. SCTP).
 *
 * #PSocket supports INET and INET6 address families which specify network
 * communication addresses used by created sockets: IPv4 and IPv6,
 * correspondingly. INET6 family is not supported on all platforms, refer to
 * documentation for a particular target platform.
 *
 * #PSocket supports different underlying data transfer protocols: TCP, UDP and
 * others. Note that not all protocols can be used with any socket type, i.e.
 * you can use the TCP protocol with a stream socket, but you can't use the UDP
 * protocol with the stream socket. You can specify #P_SOCKET_PROTOCOL_DEFAULT
 * protocol when creating a socket and appropriate the best matching socket type
 * will be selected.
 *
 * In a common socket communication case server and client sides are involved.
 * Depending on whether sockets are connection oriented, there are slightly
 * different action sequences for data exchanging.
 *
 * For connection oriented sockets the server side acts as following:
 * - creates a socket using p_socket_new();
 * - binds the socket to a particular local address using p_socket_bind();
 * - starts to listen incoming connections using p_socket_listen();
 * - takes an incoming connection from the internal queue using
 * p_socket_accept().
 *
 * The client side acts as following:
 * - creates a socket using p_socket_new();
 * - binds the socket to a particular local address using p_socket_bind();
 * - connects to the server using p_socket_connect().
 *
 * After the connection was successfully established, both the sides can send
 * and receive data from each other using p_socket_send() and
 * p_socket_receive(). Binding of the client socket is actually optional.
 *
 * When using connection-less sockets, all is a bit simpler. There is no server
 * side or client side - anyone can send and receive data without establishing a
 * connection. Just create a socket, bind it to a local address and send/receive
 * data using p_socket_send_to() and p_socket_receive(). You can also call
 * p_socket_connect() on a connection-less socket to prevent passing the target
 * address each time when sending data and then use p_socket_send() instead of
 * p_socket_send_to(). This time binding is required.
 *
 * #PSocket can operate in blocking and non-blocking (async) modes. By default
 * it is in the blocking mode. When using #PSocket in the blocking mode each
 * non-immediate call on it will block a caller thread until an I/O operation
 * will be completed. For example, the p_socket_accept() call can wait for an
 * incoming connection for some time, and calling it on a blocking socket will
 * prevent the caller thread from further execution until it receives a new
 * incoming connection. In the non-blocking mode any call will return
 * immediately and you must check its result. You can set the socket mode using
 * p_socket_set_blocking().
 *
 * #PSocket always puts a socket descriptor (or SOCKET handle on Windows) into
 * the non-blocking mode and emulates the blocking mode if required. If you need
 * to perform some hacks and need blocking behavior from the descriptor for some
 * reason, use p_socket_get_fd() to get an internal socket descriptor (SOCKET
 * handle on Windows).
 *
 * The close-on-exec flag is always set on the socket desciptor. Use
 * p_socket_get_fd() to overwrite this behavior.
 *
 * #PSocket ignores the SIGPIPE signal on UNIX systems if possible. Take it into
 * account if you want to handle this signal.
 *
 * Note that before using the #PSocket API you must call p_libsys_init() in
 * order to initialize system resources (on UNIX this will do nothing, but on
 * Windows this routine is required). Usually this routine should be called on a
 * program's start.
 *
 * Here is an example of #PSocket usage:
 * @code
 * PSocketAddress *addr;
 * PSocket	  *sock;
 *
 * p_libsys_init ();
 * ...
 * if ((addr = p_socket_address_new ("127.0.0.1", 5432)) == NULL) {
 *	...
 * }
 *
 * if ((sock = p_socket_new (P_SOCKET_FAMILY_INET,
 *			     P_SOCKET_TYPE_DATAGRAM,
 *			     P_SOCKET_PROTOCOL_UDP)) == NULL) {
 *	p_socket_address_free (addr);
 *	...
 * }
 *
 * if (!p_socket_bind (sock, addr, FALSE)) {
 *	p_socket_address_free(addr);
 *	p_socket_free(sock);
 *	...
 * }
 *
 * ...
 * p_socket_address_free (addr);
 * p_socket_close (sock);
 * p_socket_free (sock);
 * p_libsys_shutdown ();
 * @endcode
 * Here a UDP socket was created, bound to the localhost address and the port
 * 5432. Do not forget to close the socket and free memory after its usage.

 * or UDP) because they will be in a conflicted state for data receiving. But
 * the socket can be also bound for the any network interface (i.e. 0.0.0.0
 * network address) and a particular port. If you will try to bind another
 * socket without the @a allow_reuse option to a particular network address
 * (i.e. 127.0.0.1) and the same port, the p_socket_bind() call will fail.
 *
 * With the @a allow_reuse option the system will resolve this conflict: the
 * socket will be bound to the particular address and port (and will receive
 * data targeted to this particular address) while the first socket will be
 * receiving all other data matching the bound address.
 *
 * This option is system dependent, some systems do not support it. Also some
 * systems have option to reuse the address port (SO_REUSEPORT) in the same way,
 * too.
 *
 * Connection oriented sockets have another problem - the so called linger time.
 * It is a time required by the system to properly close a socket connection
 * (and this process can be quite complicated). This time can be measured from
 * several minutes to several hours (!). The socket in such a state is
 * half-dead, but it holds the bound address and attempt to bind another socket
 * on this address will fail. The @a allow_reuse option allows to bind another
 * socket on such a half-dead address, but behavior can be unexpected, it's
 * better to refer to the system documentation for that.
 *
 * In general case, a server socket should be bound with the @a allow_reuse set
 * to TRUE, while a client socket shouldn't set this option to TRUE. If you
