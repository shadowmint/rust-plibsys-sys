 * @brief Error data types
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * All error codes are splitted into the several domains. Every error should
 * belong to one of the domains described in #PErrorDomain. Think of an error
 * domain as a logical subsystem.
 *
 * Every error domain has its own enumeration with the list of possible error
 * codes. System error codes are converted to specified domains using internal
 * routines.
