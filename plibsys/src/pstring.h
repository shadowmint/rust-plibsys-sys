 * @since 0.0.1
 * @note The @a str is modified by this call, so take care for that. The
 * returned pointer points on a @a str substring, so you do not need to call
 * p_free() on it.
 *
 * The common usage of this call is following:
 * @code
 * pchar *token, *buf;
 * pchar str[] = "This is a test string"
 * pchar delim[] = " \t"
 * ...
 * token = p_strtok (str, delim, &buf);
 *
 * while (token != NULL) {
 *     printf ("Splitted string: %s\n", token);
 *     token = p_strtok (NULL, delim, &buf);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * Take attention that you need to pass the original string only once, after
 * that you should pass NULL instead. You can also pass different delimiters
 * each time.
 *
 * Some platforms do not support the third parameter and it can be remained
 * unused. In that case this call wouldn't be thread-safe.
