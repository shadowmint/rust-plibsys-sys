 * @brief Cryptographic hash function
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A cryptographic hash function is an algorithm which performs a transformation
 * of the income data to a hash value.
 *
 * One of the main requirements to all of the cryptographic hashing algorithms
 * is that any (even a considerably small) change in the input data must lead to
 * notable changes in the result hash value. It is the so called avalanche
 * effect. It helps to avoid collisions (the same hash value for different
 * input arrays).
 *
 * The cryptographic hash function is designed to be a one-way so you couldn't
 * revert the output hash value to the input data back. The length of the
 * resulting hash is a constant value depending on the algorithm being used.
 *
 * A cryptographic hash works with the incoming data using fixed length blocks
 * so it is possible to feed as many data as required.
 *
 * The cryptographic hash module supports the following hash functions:
 * - MD5;
 * - SHA-1;
 * - SHA-2/224;
 * - SHA-2/256;
 * - SHA-2/384;
 * - SHA-2/512;
 * - GOST (R 34.11-94).
 *
 * Use p_crypto_hash_new() to initialize a new hash context with one of the
 * mentioned above types. Data for hashing can be added in several chunks using
 * the p_crypto_hash_update() routine. You can add more chunks as long as the
 * hash context is open.
 *
 * The hash context becomes close in two cases: p_crypto_hash_get_string() or
 * p_crypto_hash_get_digest() was called. After that you can only get a hash in
 * a hexidemical string or in a raw representation.
 *
 * A hashing algorithm couldn't be changed after the context initialization.
