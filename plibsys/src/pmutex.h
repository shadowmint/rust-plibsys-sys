/**
 * @file pmutex.h
 * @brief Mutex routines
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A mutex is a mutual exclusive (hence mutex) synchronization primitive which
 * allows access to a critical section only to one of the concurrently running
 * threads. It is used to protected shared data structures from concurrent
 * modifications which could lead to unpredictable behavior.
 *
 * When entering a critical section a thread must call p_mutex_lock() to get a
 * lock. If another thread is already holding the lock all other threads will
 * be suspended until the lock is released with p_mutex_unlock(). After
 * releasing the lock one of the waiting threads is resumed to continue
 * execution. On most systems it is not specified whether a mutex waiting queue
 * is fair (FIFO) on not.
 *
 * The typical mutex usage:
 * @code
 * p_mutex_lock (mutex);
 *
 * ... code in critical section ...
 *
 * p_mutex_unlock (mutex);
 * @endcode
 * You can also think of the mutex as a binary semaphore.
 *
 * It is implementation dependent whether recursive locking or non-locked mutex
 * unlocking is allowed, but such actions can lead to unpredictable behavior.
 * Do not rely on such behavior in cross-platform applications.
 *
 * This is the thread scoped mutex implementation. You could not share this
 * mutex outside the process adress space, but you can share it between the
 * threads of the same process.
