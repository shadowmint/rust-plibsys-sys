 * @brief Time profiler
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * #PTimeProfiler acts like a time cronometer: in any moment of time you can
 * make a time slice to see how much time elapsed since the last slice or timer
 * start.
 *
 * This profiler is useful to gather information about execution time for calls
 * or parts of the code. It can help to leverage bottle-necks in your code.
 *
 * To start using a profiler create a new one with p_time_profiler_new() call
 * and p_time_profiler_elapsed_usecs() to get elapsed time since the creation.
 * If you need to reset a profiler use p_time_profiler_reset(). Remove a
 * profiler with p_time_profiler_free().
