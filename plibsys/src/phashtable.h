 * @brief Hash table
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A hash table is a data structure used to map keys to values. The hash table
 * consists of several internal slots which hold a list of values. A hash
 * function is used to compute an index in the array of the slots from a given
 * key. The hash function itself is fast and it takes a constant time to compute
 * the internal slot index.
 *
 * When the number of pairs in the hash table is small the lookup and insert
 * (remove) operations are very fast and have average complexity O(1), because
 * every slot holds almost the only one pair. As the number of internal slots is
 * fixed, the increasing number of pairs will lead to degraded performance and
 * the average complexity of the operations can drop to O(N) in the worst case.
 * This is because the more pairs are inserted the more longer the list of
 * values is placed in every slot.
 *
 * This is a simple hash table implementation which is not intended for heavy
 * usage (several thousands), see #PTree if you need the best performance on
 * large data sets. This implementation doesn't support multi-inserts when
 * several values belong to the same key.
 *
 * Note that #PHashTable stores keys and values only as pointers, so you need
 * to free used memory manually, p_hash_table_free() will not do it in any way.
 *
 * Integers (up to 32 bits) can be stored in pointers using #P_POINTER_TO_INT
 * and #P_INT_TO_POINTER macros.
