 * @brief Socket address wrapper
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A socket address is usually represented by a network address (IPv4 or IPv6)
 * and a port number (though some other naming schemes and parameters are
 * possible).
 *
 * Socket address parameters are stored inside a special system (native)
 * structure in the binary (raw) form. The native structure varies with an
 * operating system and a network protocol. #PSocketAddress acts like a thin
 * wrapper around that native address structure and unifies manipulation of
 * socket address data.
 *
 * #PSocketAddress supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses which consist of an IP
 * address and a port number. IPv6 support is system dependent and doesn't
 * provided for all the platforms. Sometimes you may also need to enable IPv6
 * support in the system to make it working.
 *
 * Convenient methods to create special addresses are provided: for the loopback
 * interface use p_socket_address_new_loopback(), for the any-address interface
 * use p_socket_address_new_any().
 *
 * If you want to get the underlying native address structure for further usage
 * in system calls use p_socket_address_to_native(), and
 * p_socket_address_new_from_native() for a vice versa conversion.
