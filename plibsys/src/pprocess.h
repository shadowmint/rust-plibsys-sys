 *
 * A process is an executing unit in an operating system with its own address
 * space. Every process can be identified with a unique identifier called PID.
 * To get a PID of the currently running process call
 * p_process_get_current_pid(). To check whether a process with a given PID is
 * running up use p_process_is_running().
