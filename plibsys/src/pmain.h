/**
 * @file pmain.h
 * @brief Library initialization
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * Before using the library you must to initialize it properly. Use
 * p_libsys_init() to initialize the library. Please note that you need to call
 * it only once, not in every thread. This call is not MT-safe (because it also
 * initializes the threading subsystem itself), so it is best to place it in the
 * program's main thread, when the program starts.
 *
 * The only difference between p_libsys_init() and p_libsys_init_full() is that
 * the latter one allows to setup memory management routines before doing any
 * internal library call. This way you can ensure to use provided memory
 * management everywhere (even for library initialization).
 *
 * When you do not need the library anymore release used resourses with the
 * p_libsys_shutdown() routine. You should only call it once, too. This call is
 * not MT-safe (because it also deinitializes the threading subsystem itself),
 * so it is best to place it in the program's main thread, when the program
 * finishes.
 *
 * It is not recommended to call the initialization and deinitialization
 * routines on Windows in the DllMain() call because it may require libraries
 * other than kernel32.dll.
