 * @brief Shared memory buffer
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A shared memory buffer works like any other buffer but it is built upon a
 * shared memory region instead of the process-only address space. Thus it
 * inherits all the advantages and disadvantages of shared memory behavior. You
 * should read about #PShm before using this buffer implementation to understand
 * underlying restrictions.
 *
 * The shared memory buffer is process-wide and identified by its name across
 * the system, thus it can be opened by any process if it knows its name. Use
 * p_shm_buffer_new() to open the shared memory buffer and p_shm_buffer_free()
 * to close it.
 *
 * All read/write operations are completely thread- and process-safe, which
 * means that no other synchronization primitive is required, even for inter-
 * process access. A #PShm locking mechanism is used for access synchronization.
 *
 * The buffer is cyclic and non-overridable which means that you wouldn't get
 * buffer overflow and wouldn't override previously written data until reading
 * it.
 *
 * The read operation checks whether there is any data available and reads it in
 * case of successful check. After reading the data used space in the buffer is
 * marked as free and any subsequent write operation may overwrite it. Thus you
 * couldn't read the same data twice. The read operation is performed with the
 * p_shm_buffer_read() call.
 *
 * The write operation checks whether there is enough free space available and
 * writes a given memory block only if the buffer has enough free space.
 * Otherwise no data is written. The write operation is performed with the
 * p_shm_buffer_write() call.
 *
 * Data can be read and written into the buffer only sequentially. There is no
 * way to access an arbitrary address inside the buffer.
 *
 * You can take ownership of the shared memory buffer with
 * p_shm_buffer_take_ownership() to explicitly remove it from the system after
 * closing. Please refer to the #PShm description to understand the intention of
 * this action.
