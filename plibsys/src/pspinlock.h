/**
 * @file pspinlock.h
 * @brief Light-weight atomic spinlock
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A spinlock is an inter-thread synchronization primitive based on atomic
 * operations. It allows to guard a critical section from concurrent access of
 * multiple threads at once. It is very similar to a mutex in semantics, but
 * inside it provides a more light-weight and fast locking mechanism without
 * thread sleeping and undesirable context switching. Thus spinlocks should be
 * used only for small code sections, otherwise long-time spinning can cause
 * extensive CPU time waste by waiting threads.
 *
 * As the spinlock is based on atomic operations it would have the real meaning
 * only if an underlying atomic model is lock-free (not simulated using the
 * mutex). You can check if the atomic model is lock-free with
 * p_atomic_is_lock_free(). Otherwise usage of spinlocks will be the same as the
 * ordinary mutex.
 *
 * To create a new spinlock primitive the p_spinlock_new() routine should be
 * called, to delete the unused spinlock primitive use p_spinlock_free().
 *
 * Use p_spinlock_lock() or p_spinlock_trylock() to synchronize access at the
 * beginning of the critical section. Only the one thread is allowed to pass
 * this call, others will wait for the p_spinlock_unlock() call which marks the
 * end of the critical section. This way the critical section code is guarded
 * against concurrent access of multiple threads at once.
