 *
 * When the default version of close used on Mac OS X fails with EINTR, the
 * file descriptor is not in a deterministic state. It may have been closed,
 * or it may not have been. This makes it impossible to gracefully recover
 * from the error. If the close is retried after the FD has been closed, the
 * subsequent close can report EBADF, or worse, it can close an unrelated FD
 * opened by another thread. If the close is not retried after the FD has been
 * left open, the FD is leaked. Neither of these are good options.
 *
 * Mac OS X provides an alternate version of close, close$NOCANCEL. This
 * version will never fail with EINTR before the FD is actually closed. With
 * this version, it is thus safe to call close without checking for EINTR (as
 * the HANDLE_EINTR macro does) and not risk leaking the FD. In fact, mixing
 * this verison of close with HANDLE_EINTR is hazardous.
 *
 * The $NOCANCEL variants of various system calls are activated by compiling
 * with __DARWIN_NON_CANCELABLE, which prevents them from being pthread
 * cancellation points. Rather than taking such a heavy-handed approach, this
 * file implements an alternative: to use the $NOCANCEL variant of close (thus
 * preventing it from being a pthread cancellation point) without affecting
 * any other system calls.
 *
 * This file operates by providing a close function with the non-$NOCANCEL
 * symbol name expected for the compilation environment as set by <unistd.h>
 * and <sys/cdefs.h> (the DARWIN_ALIAS_C macro). That function calls the
 * $NOCANCEL variant, which is resolved from libsyscall. By linking with this
 * version of close prior to the libsyscall version, close's implementation is
 * overridden.
