/**
 * @file psemaphore.h
 * @brief Semaphore routines
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A semaphore is a synchronization primitive which controls access to shared
 * data from the concurrently running threads. Unlike a mutex (which is a
 * particular case of a binary semaphore) it allows concurrent access not to
 * only the one thread.
 *
 * The semaphore has a counter which means the number of available resources
 * (units). Before entering a critical section a thread must perform the so
 * called P (acquire) operation: if the counter is positive it decrements the
 * counter by 1 and continues execution; otherwise the thread is suspended until
 * the counter becomes positive. Before leaving the critical section the thread
 * must perform the so called V (release) operation: increments the counter by 1
 * and wakes up a waiting thread from the queue (if any).
 *
 * You can think about the semaphore as a resource controller: the P operation
 * takes one unit, while the V operation gives one unit back. The thread could
 * not continue execution without taking a resource unit. By setting the initial
 * semaphore counter value you can control how much concurrent threads can work
 * with a shared resource.
 *
 * This semaphore implementation is process-wide so you can synchronize not only
 * the threads. But it makes this IPC primitive (actually like any other IPC
 * primitive, as well) relatively heavy. Consider using a mutex or a spinlock
 * instead if you do not need to cross a process boundary.
 *
 * A process-wide semaphore is identified by its name across the system, thus it
 * is also called a named semaphore. Use p_semaphore_new() to open the named
 * semaphore and p_semaphore_free() to close it.
 *
 * Please note the following platform specific differences:
 *
 * - Windows doesn't own IPC objects (processes own them), which means that a
 * semaphore will be removed from the system after the last process or thread
 * closes it (or after terminating all the processes and threads holding open
 * semaphore).
 *
 * - UNIX systems own IPC objects. Because of that UNIX IPC objects can survive
 * an application crash: an already used semaphore can be opened in a locked
 * state and an application can fail into a deadlock or an inconsistent state.
 * This could happen if you have not closed all the open semaphores explicitly
 * before terminating the application.
 *
 * - IRIX allows to open several instances of a semaphore within the single
 * process, but it will close the object after the first close call from any of
 * the threads within the process.
 *
 * Use the third argument as #P_SEM_ACCESS_CREATE in p_semaphore_new() to reset
 * a semaphore value while opening it. This argument is ignored on Windows. You
 * can also take ownership of the semaphore with p_semaphore_take_ownership() to
 * explicitly remove it from the system after closing.

 *
 * If you take ownership of a semaphore object, p_semaphore_free() will try to

 * systems where the semaphore can survive an application crash. On the Windows
 * platform this call has no effect.
 *
 * The common usage of this call is upon application startup to ensure that the
 * semaphore from the previous crash will be unlinked from the system. To do
 * that, call p_semaphore_new(), take ownership of the semaphore object and
 * remove it with the p_semaphore_free() call. After that, create it again.
 *
 * You can also do the same thing upon semaphore creation passing
 * #P_SEM_ACCESS_CREATE to p_semaphore_new(). The only difference is that you
 * should already know whether this semaphore object is from the previous crash
 * or not.
