 * @brief Shared memory
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * Shared memory is a memory segment which can be accessed from several threads
 * or processes. It provides an efficient way to transfer large blocks of data
 * between processes. It can be used as any other regular memory segment in an
 * application.
 *
 * Shared memory acts like an inter-process communication method. This memory
 * exchange implementation is process-wide so you can transfer data not only
 * between the threads. But it makes this IPC method (actually like any other
 * IPC method, as well) relatively heavy. Consider using other approaches
 * instead if you do not need to cross the process boundary.
 *
 * A shared memory segment doesn't provide any synchronization primitives itself
 * which means that several processes or threads can concurrently write and read
 * from it. This can lead to data consistency problems. To avoid such situations
 * a locking mechanism is provided: use p_shm_lock() before entering a critical
 * section on the memory segment and p_shm_unlock() when leaving this section.
 * The locking mechanism is working across the process boundary.
 *
 * A process-wide shared memory segment is identified by its name across the
 * system, thus it is also called a named memory segment. Use p_shm_new() to
 * open the named shared memory segment and p_shm_free() to close it.
 *
 * Please note the following platform specific differences:
 *
 * - Windows doesn't own IPC objects (processes own them), which means that a
 * shared memory segment will be removed after the last process or thread
 * detaches (or after terminating all the processes and threads attached to the
 * segment) it.
 *
 * - UNIX systems own IPC objects. Because of that UNIX IPC objects can survive
 * an application crash: the attached shared memory segment can contain data
 * from the previous working session. This could happen if you have not detached
 * from all the shared memory segments explicitly before terminating the
 * application.
 *
 * - HP-UX has limitations due to its MPAS/MGAS features, so you couldn't attach
 * to the same memory segment twice from the same process.
 *
 * - IRIX allows to open several instances of the same buffer within the single
 * process, but it will close the object after the first close call from any of
 * the threads within the process.
 *
 * You can take ownership of the shared memory segment with
 * p_shm_take_ownership() to explicitly remove it from the system after closing.
